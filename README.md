# BriefMeet
BriefMeet is perfect for short encounters at large social and/or networking events! 
Users can take pictures (selfies) with those they meet, and record their names and other information 
if they wish on the app in respective event categories. The app works on the idea of being able to 
create that bond of taking a picture with someone - it's a much more memorable experience than a 
simple handshake and "Nice to meet you," and helps to identify and remember that someone later in the future.
